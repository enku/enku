# About

Mostly my personal GitHub profile is for working on personal projects. While I
am (usually) a professional software developer, I enjoy programming as a hobby
as well. Most of my projects are my way of scratching my own itch, which is
why some are not for "mass consumption" or my own take on [much better,
well-maintained project]. It's soothing like knitting or maybe baking. Some
projects I'm particularly proud of are:

* [TeamPlayer](https://github.com/enku/teamplayer)
* [Gentoo Build Publisher](https://github.com/enku/gentoo-build-publisher)
* [Larry](https://github.com/enku/larry)
* [Airport](https://github.com/enku/airport)

## Languages

For my personal projects, I mostly program in Python. It is my go-to
programming language. If programming languages were guitars then Python would
be my Lucille (although I'm certainly no
[King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.B._King)). I do, however, know and
occasionally enjoy such other programming languages as:

* JavaScript: Can't work the web without JavaScript. But mostly I like working
  in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* Go: I haven't done much with Go but there are definately some things I like
  about it especially its underlying philosophy(ies).
* Zig: I actually haven't done anything with Zig yet, but it looks awesome.
* C#: A while back I taught myself C#. That's about it.
* C: I appreciate that every time I learn a new language and then look at C I
  feel I know and appreciate it more. C is as ubiquitous as it is
  underappreciated. Like Grandma (Thanks Grandma).
* MUMPS: Don't ask.

## Thanks

I have a lot of gratitude for many things past and present, including:

* [Boscov's at the Dover
  Mall](https://locations.boscovs.com/de/dover/1365-n-dupont-hwy.html).
  Believe it or not, the personal computers on display at the Boscov's
  department store is actually how I first learned to program computers.
* Coach John Hollis for his encouragement, support and believing in me.
* Mr. Keith O'neal for giving me so many opportunities and kickstarting my
  career.
* And, of course, Grandma.
